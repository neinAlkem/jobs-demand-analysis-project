# Introduction
This project is focused on analyzing top-paying jobs and skill demand in the IT field. The primary goal is to enhance my SQL skills by working through real-world data and queries. The project was originally created by [Luke Barrouse](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse), but I have made modifications to the original questions to better align with my learning objectives. Through this analysis, I aim to gain deeper insights into the IT job market while sharpening my SQL capabilities.

### The Question To Answer
1. What are the top-paying jobs in IT Field?
2. What skills are required for these high-paying IT jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand in the market?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. Which country offer the highest average salary for IT Jobs?

# Tools
This project utilizes a variety of tools to manage, analyze, and version control the data effectively:

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** :
VSCode is the integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and executing SQL queries. It offers a robust environment with extensions that enhance SQL coding, debugging, and visualization, making it easier to interact with the database and visualize query results.
- **PostgreSQL Database** :
PostgreSQL is the chosen database management system (DBMS) for this project. It is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, feature robustness, and flexibility. PostgreSQL is used to store, manage, and query the IT job and skills data efficiently.
- **SQL** :
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used for querying and analyzing data in this project. It allows for extracting insights from the data stored in the PostgreSQL database by writing and executing complex queries, which is the core of this analysis.
- **Git & GitHub** : Git is the version control system used to track changes to the project's codebase. GitHub is the platform where the project repository is hosted, enabling collaboration, version tracking, and code sharing. All code changes, updates, and version history are managed using Git and pushed to GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
